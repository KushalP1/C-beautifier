# C-beautifier

This repository contains code for a beautifier which formats a given C code in HTML with multiple features. The HTML-formatted text highlights C keywords and directives like define and include, operators, constants and comments. It adds line numbers to the output and indents statements and statement blocks. This work has been completed as a part of my undergraduate coursework on Compilers.

## Lex Specification

The Lex specification that consists of the definations of the patterns for the tokens that make up a C source program (Including header files) are written in the beautify.l file. These patterns trigger action functions which print the appropriate HTML tags for the C code.

## Symbol table

symbol.c contains code for a symbol table, to store keywords and identifiers. The identifiers are hyper-linked in the HTML output, so that when a user clicks on an identifier, the browser jumps to the first line of code in the file where the identifier first occurred. This assumes that identifiers are mostly globally declared in the C code, such as functions and other globals. Note that this doesn't necessarily work for local variables. Since a lexical analyzer is not aware of the syntax, we are not making any attempts to make the linkage more intelligent.

## File details

beautify.c is the C code generated by flex.  
Input/input.c is the input code which needs to be presented in a formatted HTML document.  
Output/out.html is the generated HTML file.
